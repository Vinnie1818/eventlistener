										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the second wave of pandemic nears its end, Lock the box &#8211; Bookfairs will not be the same anymore. It will have to have the added practices we have learnt to cope in the abnormal situations. Book fairs need to address requirements of the new normal. Concerns such as social distancing, wearing of masks, vaccination etc. will all be part of the new normal.</p>
<p>“In the new age of book fairs, the online and /or hybrid models will be tried by various organizers from time to time. The event will be fine-tuned to suit requirements of one and all. We at Pune Bookfair will ensure that the modern day practices and the requirements of the new normal will be incorporated in our exhibitions, conferences and meets (offline) so as to benefit one and all.</p>
